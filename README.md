# LSMS Data Dissemination

Part of EPAR's mission includes a "commitment to open access tools and broadly
accessible dissemination." We hope to empower people in developing countries to
make use of the data we create. As part of that mission we have created this
repository as a resource for fellow researchers and decision makers. 

The data in this repository were created using the raw
[LSMS-ISA](http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA)
data collected by the World Bank. The data were processed using the Stata do files in the
[code repository](https://github.com/EvansSchoolPolicyAnalysisAndResearch/LSMS-Agricultural-Indicators-Code).
Updates to the code repository are more frequent than updates to the data repository. Updates to this repository
include the SHA of the code repository commit that was used to generate the update; using the do files from that
snapshot and the raw data versions noted in the do file header and readme should produce identical results. 

See the spreadsheet for compiled summary statistics across all waves; these estimates are also available using our
[AgQuery](https://www.agquery.org) tool and our more interactive AgQuery+ tool (http://v2254.host.s.uw.edu/; in beta, estimates produced from this application may vary from the estimates provided here).
This spreadsheet also contains summarized construction decisions for several indicators; see the individual wave readme files in the code repository for additional
detail and summaries of wave-specific challenges that we have encountered. The code table of contents provides some guidance
if you wish to construct some indicators using your own assumptions.

### List of LSMS-ISA Waves Available

## Ethiopia ESS

The data in Ethiopia ESS folder were constructed from data collected by the 
[Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA)](http://www.csa.gov.et/) during 
the five waves of its Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS).

* __Wave 1:__ 2011-12
* __Wave 2:__ 2013-14
* __Wave 3:__ 2015-16
* __Wave 4:__ 2018-19
* __Wave 5:__ 2021-22

## Nigeria GHS

The data in the Nigeria GHS folder were constructed from data collected by the 
[Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)](http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/)
during the four waves of its General Household Survey Panel.
The surveys were administered in the following years:

* __Wave 1:__ 2010-11
* __Wave 2:__ 2012-13
* __Wave 3:__ 2015-16
* __Wave 4:__ 2018-19
* __Wave 5:__ 2022-23

## Tanzania NPS

The data in the Tanzania NPS folder were constructed from data collected by the 
[Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)](http://www.nbs.go.tz/) during the
five waves of its Tanzania National Panel Survey (TZNPS).
The surveys were administered in the following years:

* __Wave 1:__ 2008-09
* __Wave 2:__ 2010-11
* __Wave 3:__ 2012-13
* __Wave 4:__ 2014-15
* __Wave 5:__ 2020-21
* __SDD:__ 2019-20 * NB: This the "extended panel" dataset that is a continuation of Wave 4 before the panel refresh in Wave 5. Previous releases had this release erroneously labeled as "Wave 5"

## Malawi IHS

The data in the Malawi IHS folder are a combination of the Malawi Integrated Household Survey (IHS) and Integrated Household Panel Survey (IHPS) collected by the 
[Malawi National Statistical Office (NSO)](https://www.finance.gov.mw/index.php/departments/national-statistical-office). IHS and IHPS data were released
separately in LSMS-ISA waves 3 and 4. LSMS-ISA Wave 2 consists solely of IHPS households and has no cross section, and so the sample size is considerably smaller than
in the other survey waves. The surveys were administered in the following years:

* __LSMS-ISA Wave 1 (IHS3, IHPS 2010)__: 2010-11
* __LSMS-ISA Wave 2 (IHPS 2013)__: 2013
* __LSMS-ISA Wave 3 (IHS4, IHPS 2016)__: 2016-17
* __LSMS-ISA Wave 4 (IHS5, IHPS 2019)__: 2019-20

## Uganda NPS  

The data in the Uganda NPS folder were constructed from data collected by the 
[Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS)](https://www.ubos.org/) during the seven waves
of its Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS). 
The surveys were administered in the following years:

* __Wave 1:__ 2009-10
* __Wave 2:__ 2010-11
* __Wave 3:__ 2011-12
* __Wave 4:__ 2013-14
* __Wave 5:__ 2015-16
* __Wave 7:__ 2018-19
* __Wave 8:__ 2019-20
